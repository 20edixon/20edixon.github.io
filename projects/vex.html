    <h2>2022-2023 Season - slapshot</h2>

    Our team debuted in the 2022-2023 Season "Slapshot" under the name "AAA", 
    standing for always above avarage. This season was by far our most 
    sucessful. Our robot, pictured on the left, was undefeated in the 
    regional competitoins, and we finished as sixth best team in the 
    country at the national level. We also won an award for the best 
    constructed robot, which qualified us for the world championship 
    in Dallas, Teaxs. Here, we fianlly met out match, and finished 36th 
    in our league.

    <br><br>

    The legacy of this robot is still very much alive however, even after 
    its dismantling. This piture of our robot is one of the first images
    that appears when searching "vex robotics" into google. 

    <br><br>

    During the season I was one of the drivers for the team, though I was 
    also involved in the construction and coding of the robot.

    <h2>2023-2024 Season - Over under</h2>

    In Vex Robotics, different age groups compete at different levels,
    and during this season we were promoted from the plastic Vex IQ, to the
    metal Vex V5. This was a whole new experience for the team, and our
    unfamiliarity with the new system showed. We were unable to replicate
    the success of the previous season, barely qualifying for the national
    competetion, but achieving nothing there.
    
    <br><br>

    I was no longer a driver for this season as only one driver is required in
    Vex V5. I dedicated my time to the construction and coding of the robot, 
    though I also helped design it.

    <h2>2024-2025 Season - High Stakes</h2>

    In reflection of the previous season, we rebranded the team to "Ahuramazda",
    an ancient Persian God, to distance oursleves from our failure. In this season we experienced slightly more success,
    we had learned much from our mistakes in the previous year, and dedicated
    lots of time to try and fix them or avoid making the same ones. Crucially,
    the robot still ended up being rushed, partially due to GCSEs, and was unreliable 
    as a result. We did qualify for the national competetion, however, we were unable 
    to achieve anything there.

    <br><br>

    It was in this season that we learned the most. We had a better understanding of 
    what the new robots capable of doing. We also implemented a variaty of new techniques
    and technology into our robot, such as pneumatics.

    <br><br>

    This was the first year where my main purpose was to be the programmer for the team.
    It took my some time to adjust to my new responsibilities, but also to understand the 
    quirks of vexcode. Many of the programs for driving, swithces, and other esentials I 
    wrote in this season are still used in our robot today.

    <h2>Current Season - Push Back</h2>

    The current seasons looks as if it is going to be our best one yet. We have analyised 
    the mistakes we have made from all our previous seasons, and have been relentless in our goal
    of avoiding them all. Additionally, this year will be our last one participating in vex
    Robotics, so this season acts as a final chance to regain some of the glory of our debut
    season. Our robot, pictured on the left, is our most advanced design we have ever created,
    utilising pneumatics, sensors, and even physics simulations.
    
    <br><br>

    This year, I am continuing my responsibilities as the main programmer. However, I am also
    now in-charge of our teams notebook, proofing and editing it to ensure that it displays our 
    work as best we can to the judges.
