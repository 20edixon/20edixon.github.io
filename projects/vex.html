    <h2>2022-2023 Season - slapshot</h2>

    Our team debuted in the 2022-2023 Season "Slapshot under the name AAA, 
    standing for always above avarage. This season was by far our most 
    sucessful, our robot, pictured on the left, was undefeated in the 
    regional competitoins, and we finished as sixth best team in the 
    country at the national level. We also won an award for the best 
    constructed robot, and this qualified us for the world championship 
    in Dallas, Teaxs. Here, we fianlly met out match, and finished 36th 
    in our league.

    <br><br>

    The legacy of this robot is still very much alive however, even after 
    its dismantleing. This piture of our robot is one of the first images
    that appears when searching "vex robotics" into google.

    During the season I was one of the drivers for the team, though I was 
    also involved in the construction and coding of the robot.
