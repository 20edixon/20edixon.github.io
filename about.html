<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class = "about_box">
  <div class = "logos"><img src="images/programming logos.png"></div> 

  Hello! I'm Elliott, an A Level student from Kent, currently studying 
  Edexcel Computer Science. I am fluent in a variety of programming 
  languages such as HTML, CSS and Python, that I have used in my studies 
  and in the creation of this website. <br><br>

  I have a passion for coding and technology, and I am always looking for
  new ways to improve my existing skills and learn new ones.<br><br>
  
  In my free time, I enjoy working on personal coding projects, gaming, 
  and playing a variety of musical instruments. History, particularly 
  15th Century Europe, is another personal intresest, one that I have 
  been fortunate enough to reaserch as part of my studies.

  <br><br>

  I am also involved in <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/?___store=vexroboticsuk&___from_store=vexrobotics&srsltid=AfmBOopbcUHv2DJAIgG4_22z0OQTQ9A9EebBQXnviWzb-Hvy5f-l9DOy">
    Vex Robotics</a>, and am the lead programmer for
  my school's team, though I take on a variety of other responsibilities,
  such as editing our notebook. As a team, we have accomplished much over 
  the years, competing at national level, and even at international level
  in the 2022-2023 season. 
  <br><br>

  This website serves as a portfolio of my work and a platform to share 
  my thoughts and ideas on various topics related to technology and 
  coding. <br><br>
  
  Feel free to explore the different sections of the website to learn 
  more about me and my projects. If you have any questions or would like 
  to get in touch, please don't hesitate to contact me through the 
  contact page.
